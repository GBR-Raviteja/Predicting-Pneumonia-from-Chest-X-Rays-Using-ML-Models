# Predicting Pneumonia from Chest X-Rays Using ML Models

This repository summarizes the project on diagnosing pneumonia via chest X-rays using classical and advanced machine learning techniques.

## Abstract
The study explores the use of ML models (SVC, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, ANN, etc.) to classify chest X-rays for pneumonia detection. Preprocessing, feature engineering, and data augmentation improve model accuracy. SVC (97%), RF (95%) and ANN (93%) show top diagnostic performance.

## Key Features
- Multiple ML models implemented and compared
- Focus on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score
- Data preprocessing and balancing, augmentation techniques
- Model evaluation with confusion matrix and ROC curves

## Technologies & Datasets
- Python, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, Keras, OpenCV
- Public chest X-ray datasets (Kaggle, NIH ChestX-ray8)
- Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

## How to Use
1. Preprocess and augment chest X-ray images.
2. Train and evaluate selected ML models.
3. Compare results using key performance metrics.
4. Identify the most suitable model for deployment.
