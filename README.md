# Predicting-Pneumonia-from-Chest-X-Rays-Using-ML-Models
This paper evaluates multiple machine learning models—SVC, Random Forest, ANN, and others—for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Data preprocessing and augmentation improve robustness, with SVC achieving a maximum accuracy of 97%. The study highlights the promise of ML as a diagnostic tool.
